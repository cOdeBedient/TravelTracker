## Context:
<!-- wins, challenges, time spent, etc -->
- Individual project by programmer in his 10th week of learning coding.
- Approximately 30 hours to complete test suite and functionality
- Goals:
  
  - Perform data manipulation with prototype methods
  - Create easily navigable and pleasing user interface
  - Use SRP code that strives for purity
  - Implement robust testing suite using TDD
  - Retrieve and POST data with network requests
  - Design an accessible website
    
- Wins:

  - Implementation of WAI-ARIA states for collapsed trip details to increase accessibility
  - fluid error handling to address incorrect inputs and network errors
  - manipulation of elements via scss to create an simple but interesting interface.
  
- Challenges:
  
  - Accessing and manipulating interwoven datat across multiple datasets.
  - Building an entire website interface and functional app from scratch.
  - Developing cohesive user stories without strict guidelines.

## Future Improvements:
  - More refactoring of repetetive code, particularly in the DOM functions
  - Dynamically toggle user trips on and off.
